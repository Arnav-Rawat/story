Once, in the mystical land of Eldoria, there lived a mighty warrior who went by the moniker of Johnathon Alive. He guarded the land with all his might
and no opposing force ever dared to step foot into his domain. He was highly respected and loved by the residents of Eldoria, for he was regarded as
the "Chosen One". In the wonderful land of Eldoria, resided by mystical beings, where everything defied common understanding, there was a powerful dark
force looming. Johnathon Alive was naturally informed about this commotion. He promptly went to the village of Magiko, from where the dark sightings were reported.
However, once he went there, all he saw was carnage."There could only be one person behind this...", he thought. "Jax Alive...". Jax was Johnathon ALive's 
twin brother who gave in to the dark arts and was abandoned by Johnathon soon after. Ever since then, these strange events have become commonplace. Johnathon
always had a link to his brother's whereabouts, since their minds were interconnected from birth. He went into the dark lair and saw Jax, sharpening
his dark blade. Johnathon quickly drew his own blade and struck down upon his brother. His brother, However, was no pushover either. He skillfully
parried his strike and struck down upon him with dark fury. Johnathon, the guardian of light, seared through the darkness that consumed the lair.
Their battle exerted such immense power that the entire lair blew up into smitherenes. Johnathon got a hold of his brother, but before he could slay him,
he got an epiphany. Images flashed through his mind. It was not Jax who brought carnage upon Magiko. It was a powerfulbeast from another dimension.
